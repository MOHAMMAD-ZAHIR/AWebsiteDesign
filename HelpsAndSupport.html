                            <h4>Packaging Protects Your Shipment</h4>
                            <p>Good quality packaging is critical to protecting your shipment during transportation. DHL provides a range of packaging supplies that are tried and tested. However, if you prefer to use your own materials, the following provides some general guidelines.</p>
                            <ul>Material
                                <li>Always use high quality corrugated cardboard boxes for parcels. For fragile or heavy items, double-wall or tri-wall constructions are recommended.</li>
                                <li>Avoid reusing old boxes as they may have lost some of their rigidity.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>Strength
                                <li>Look out for the manufacturer stamp which tells you information about the construction type and strength of a box. Ask your box supplier for more information as required.</li>
                                <li>Refer to the box specifications below to select suitable packaging for the weight of your shipment.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>Size
                                <li>Under-filled boxes may collapse and over-filled boxes may burst. Prevent this by choosing a box with the right size for the content being shipped.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="pack">
                            <h4>Apply Packing Techniques</h4>
                            <p>Here are some important principles applicable for packing your shipment contents.</p>
                            <ul>Leave No Empty Space
                                <li>It is important to completely fill empty space within the box to avoid contents moving during transit which can cause damage to both contents and box.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>6 cm Distance
                                <li>Always place items being shipped in the center of the box with at least 6cm of separation from any external walls or corners.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>Wrap Items Individually and Use Dividers
                                <li>When shipping multiple items in a single package, always wrap each item individually and separate with corrugated inserts or other divider materials as appropriate</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="seal">
                            <h4>Protect with a Good Seal</h4>
                            <p>Both the adhesive tapes you choose and how you seal the shipment together makes a difference in protecting your shipment contents from being exposed or damaged during transit.</p>
                            <ul>Use Pressure Sensitive Tape
                                <li>Polypropylene tape (brown plastic tape)</li>
                                <li>Vinyl adhesive tape (electrical tape)</li>
                                <li>Fiber-reinforced paper tape (duct tape)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>Avoid Using
                                <li>Kraft Paper Tape</li>
                                <li>Cellophane Tape</li>
                                <li>String</li>

                            <h4>Applying Shipment Label</h4>
                            <p>Displaying the shipment labels clearly is important in ensuring that your shipment moves swiftly through DHL's network.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Ensure the label is wholly visible on one surface and that the label does not cover any seams.</li>
                                <li>Do not let other labels, tapes or paperwork cover the shipment label.</li>
                                <li>We never recommend using an old box but if you do, ensure all outdated shipment labels are removed prior to use.</li>
                                <li>Placing a spare label inside the package will help us identify your shipment if the original label becomes detached or damaged.</li>
                                <li>If you need to apply other labels on your shipment, please avoid placing them on the same surface as the shipment label.</li>
                                <li>Use a plastic self-adhesive clear window pouch to hold any loose documents that are required to be placed outside of the box.</li>
                            </ul>
